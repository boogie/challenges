# Challenges

This is a collection of my personal Hackathon projects, "One Day Challenges".

## Why?

My goal is to learn new things, experience project management, and do something interesting and useful (for me).

Learning is something I'm interested in, and enjoy. Most of the time these projects will be about new technology,
but I'm open to have projects those are not related to technology or programming at all.

I like these Hackathons, because I always learn project management stuff as well. Making a list of tasks are
deliverable in time, or estimating these tasks properly is hard. Delivering something, even if the estimation was
wrong is not easy as well. Accepting failures and doing it better next time is the goal.

And I like to do crazy and impossible projects. It will be interesting to learn again and again that these are
very likely to fail.

Usefulness of these projects is relative. It'll be OK if I learn something new. But I would like to deliver projects
those will change something about my work or life.

## Rules

One day is not more than 8AM to 10PM, and contains breaks. I don't want to overload myself with 24 hour long events.

Minimal preparation should be done, like creating a project document in this repository that includes:

- the project description,
- the goal: when the project will be successful,
- the challenges (why it's hard),
- and the main tasks.

Also if the project needs physical preparation (like buying a hardware) that should be done before as well.
